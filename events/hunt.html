        <p>
          In the twisted realm of the Upside Down, reality bends and paths are never straight. Treasure Hunt throws teams into this chaos, where cryptic clues echo like radio signals from another world. Just like Hawkins’ heroes following mysterious signs, participants must decode hints, trust their instincts, and race against time to uncover the hidden treasure before darkness closes in.
